## Greetings!

I am Giang Nguyen (or Dexter). I got B.Eng in Computer Engineering at the School of [Electronics and Telecommunications](https://set.hust.edu.vn/), HUST, Hanoi in 2016.

I spent 2 years working in Hanoi, Vietnam at [DASAN Zhone Solutions Vietnam](https://dasans.com/vn/about/company/) and [G-Innovations Vietnam](https://ginno.com/) as a software engineer. After that, I came to KAIST-South Korea to pursue M.Sc in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) and graduated in 2020.

I am now a Ph.D student (President Graduate Research Fellow) at [CSSE department](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/comp/) - Auburn university, US -- working with [Prof. Anh Nguyen](https://anhnguyen.me/lab/). 

My research interests are **Explainable AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**.
