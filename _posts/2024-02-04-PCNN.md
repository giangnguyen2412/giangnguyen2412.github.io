We just finished a paper named PCNN. The project website is live [here](https://giangnguyen2412.github.io/PCNN/).

We present a new class of nearest-neighbor explanations (called PCNN) and show a novel utility of the XAI method: To improve predictions of a frozen, pretrained classifier C
. Our method consistently improves fine-grained image classification accuracy on CUB-200, Cars-196, and Dogs-120. Also, a human study finds that showing layusers our PCNN explanations improves their decision accuracy over showing only the top-1 class examples (as in prior work).
