Excited to share that I’ll be moving to San Francisco this summer to 
start a new chapter as a AI Research Scientist! 

I’ll be working on building large language models (LLMs) that are 
interpretable and truly beneficial to humans in the long run. 
If you’re around SF this summer, hit me up — would love to catch up!
