## Greetings! 🤗

Giang Nguyen (or Dexter) is a 4th-year computer science PhD student at Auburn University, US, working with [Anh Nguyen](https://anhnguyen.me/lab/). 
He is also a Presidential Fellow as he was awarded the prestigious Presidential Graduate Research Fellowship at Auburn University in 2021. 🎉


Prior to joining Auburn, he earned his M.Sc. in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, South Korea in August 2020. 🇰🇷

During his PhD, he has working as a Summer Research Associate at [JP Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence), Manhattan, NYC, NY, in the summer of 2024. 🏙️

His research interests are **Explainable AI**, **Human-AI Interaction**, and **Computer Vision**. 🧠 He has published at top-tier AI conferences (e.g. NeurIPS, CVPR) and been an active reviewer for premier AI research venues, such as CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, ICLR, and ICML. 📚

You can see his latest resume [here](https://giangnguyen2412.github.io/assets/resume/Giang_resume.pdf). 📄

## He loves nearest-neighbor-based explanations! 🤖 

- Giang has been actively showing the utility of nearest-neighbor explanations for human users in computer vision.
Check out his [NeurIPS2021](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/de043a5e421240eb846da8effe472ff1-Paper.pdf), [NeurIPS2022](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=UavQ9HYye6n), [CVPRW2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05238), and new [under-review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13651) papers. 📃

[//]: # (- Giang is deeply interested in explanation methods for large language models &#40;LLMs&#41; and how human users can interact with them effectively via explanations.)


### Working with Giang? 👨‍💻

> I have the capacity to mentor undergraduate or Master's students conducting AI research. Our latest collaboration effort has resulted in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00557). 

[//]: # (> Currently, I am mentoring a few undergraduate students in-and-outside US. 🧑‍🎓)

[//]: # (> I am also open to collaborating with researchers from different disciplines and institutions to produce excellent and high-impact research. My interests are not limited to those mentioned. Feel free to reach me at nguyengiangbkhn@gmail.com! 💌)
