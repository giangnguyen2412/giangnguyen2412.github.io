I'd like to write some book (or novel) reviews here, which are arranged by author name, and I grouped novels by content.

### Haruki Murakami

- 1Q84, Kafka on the shore: They are representatives of Murakami writing style: surrealism, fiction, reverie. The structure is like The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared. You'd feel uncomfortable at first but impossible to put it down later. 


- South of the Border, West of the Sun; Norwegian wood; Sputnik Sweetheart: You waste a life to pursue a love that never belongs to you. Painful, suffering and drowning to loneliness.


- A wild sheep chase, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: Divorced men without strange journeys.


- Men without Women: The loneliness of men, I love Scheherazade.


- Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage: Like No longer of Dazai Osamu, an extreme isolation

- Hear the Wind Sing: Hey! It is light, as a lullaby for ones craving for love. This is one of early Murakami novels when the writing style had not been well formulated; still dark, but not much.

- The Ice Man: The deepest manner of a man, who is absolutely isolated.

### Misc

- The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka

- The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand

- Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

- No longer human by Osamu Dazai
