Excited to share that I’ll be moving to San Francisco this summer to 
start a new chapter as a AI Research Scientist!

I’ll be working on building AIs that are 
interpretable and truly safe to humans in the long run at [Guide Labs](https://www.guidelabs.ai/). 
If you’re around SF this summer and onwards, hit me up — would love to catch up!

## What is interesting?

- Guide Labs was the only company I applied to—it was an all-or-nothing decision from me.

- After 8 rounds (7 technical), I landed the Research Scientist position. Applied once and got it, which is unheard of among my friends.
