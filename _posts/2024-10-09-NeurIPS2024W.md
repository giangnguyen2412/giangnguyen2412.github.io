ðŸŽ‰ Exciting News! ðŸŽ‰

I'm happy to share that my paper, "PCNN: Probable-Class Nearest-Neighbor Explanations Improve Fine-Grained Image Classification Accuracy for AIs and Humans," has been also accepted to the Interpretable AI Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024 (previously accepted at TMLR)!

A big thank you to the reviewers and organizers for this opportunity. I'm looking forward to presenting in Vancouver this December and engaging with the community on this exciting work!

For those interested, the final reviews are available on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vcySq1WUeL#discussion).

See you all at NeurIPS 2024! ðŸ™Œ
