## Greetings!

<!-- I am Giang Nguyen (or Dexter). I got B.Eng in Computer Engineering at the School of [Electronics and Telecommunications](https://set.hust.edu.vn/), HUST, Hanoi in 2016.

I spent 2 years working in Hanoi, Vietnam at [DASAN Zhone Solutions Vietnam](https://dasans.com/vn/about/company/) and [G-Innovations Vietnam](https://ginno.com/) as a software engineer. After that, I came to KAIST-South Korea to pursue M.Sc in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) and graduated in 2020.

I am now a Ph.D student (Presidential Graduate Research Fellow) at [CSSE department](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/comp/) - Auburn university, US -- working with [Prof. Anh Nguyen](https://anhnguyen.me/lab/). 

My research interests are **Explainable AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**. -->

**Giang Nguyen is a life-long researcher!**

He is going to be a 3rd-year computer science PhD student at Auburn University, US, working with [Dr. Anh Nguyen](https://anhnguyen.me/lab/). He is also a Presidential Fellow as he was awarded the prestigious Presidential Graduate Research Fellowship at Auburn University in 2021. 

Prior to joining Auburn, he earned his M.Sc in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, South Korea in August, 2020.

His research interests are **Explainable AI**, **Human-AI Interaction**, and **Computer Vision**. He has published at top-tier AI conferences (e.g. NeurIPS, CVPR) and been an active reviewer for premier AI research venues, such as CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, ICLR, and AAAI.

You can see his resume [here](https://giangnguyen2412.github.io/assets/resume/Giang_resume.pdf).

### Working with Giang?
> I have the capacity to mentor undergraduate or Master's students conducting AI research. Our latest collaboration effort has resulted in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00557). Currently, I am mentoring an undergraduate student at Auburn University in the US, and two Master's students at KAIST in South Korea.

> I am also open to collaborating with researchers from different disciplines and institutions to produce excellent and high-impact research. My interests are not limited to those mentioned. Feel free to reach me at nguyengiangbkhn@gmail.com!
