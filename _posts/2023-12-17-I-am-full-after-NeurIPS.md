After attending NeurIPS 2023, I learnt so much.

I do not talk about the scientific knowledge but the vision, and I am now super inspired and fueled by ideas.

I can literally work 16 hrs per day (I think I had been working for < 8hrs in one year ago til now) because I know that I need 
to aggressively and hungrily run experiments and catch up with my own ideas before they go away.

This is also a note for me for the importance of going the conference so that you can see the world better and can be fueled after months/years spending in the lab.
