Welcome to the "**Lessons**" page—a candid exploration of the hurdles and setbacks as well as the triumphs that have shaped my journey. 
Here, I document not just the events that didn’t go as planned, but also the successes and the invaluable lessons these experiences have taught me.

Read them with me, not with a focus on disappointment or self-congratulation, but with an appreciation for the profound insights gained through adversity and achievement.


## Looking for a Research Internship for Summer 2024

### Failure #1: Sony AI

**Story:** Sony AI reached out to me for an internship opportunity. 
I was excited to work with them because I saw they were doing some AI fairness work and I think
my expertise in Explainable AI could be useful.
After going through 3-4 rounds of interviews, they were just silent for months, although I think
I did great in the interviews. I reached out to them multiple times, but they never responded.
Bummer! 

Finally, the guy who was my contact at Sony AI reached out to me after 5 months and said they
changed the research topic.


### Failure #2: Research Internship at Apple

### Failure #3: Research Internship at Microsoft

### Failure #4: Genentech/Prescient Design Internship

### Success #1: Research Internship at Megagon Labs (Declined)
**Story:** I do love the vibe at Megagon Labs. I had a great time interviewing with them, and I was
deeply impressed by the work they are doing and the vibe of the team. The two who interviewed me
were super nice and I have no doubt that I would have had a great time working with them.
However, I had to decline the offer because I had already accepted an offer from JP Morgan Chase.

### Success #2: Research Internship at JP Morgan Chase (Accepted)
**Story:** Who does not want to work on some cool AI stuffs for the biggest financial firm in the world?
I just felt like the attraction from JP Morgan Chase was too strong to resist.
Plus, I think the compensation here is incomparable to any other internship I have seen so far.
