I'm happy to share that my paper, "Probable-class Nearest-neighbor Explanations Improve AI & Human Accuracy" has been also accepted to the Interpretable AI Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024!

A big thank you to the reviewers and organizers for this opportunity. I'm looking forward to presenting in Vancouver this December and engaging with the community on this exciting work!
