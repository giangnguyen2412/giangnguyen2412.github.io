Our work **Nearest-neighbor is more useful than feature attribution in improving human accuracy on image classification** got accepted at WHDM at NeurIPS 2021 (acceptance rate 49%).

I will later upload the poster, slide, and video of this work to this post.

It is such a good chance to expose my work and connect to XAI researchers.
