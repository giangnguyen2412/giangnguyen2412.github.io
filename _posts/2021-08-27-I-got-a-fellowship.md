I received the prestigious Presidential fellowship at Auburn university.

The prestigious Presidential Graduate Research Fellowship ($30,000 per year) is awarded to outstanding PhD students in Auburn University in the Fall 2021 semester. 

In CSSE department, I am the only student receiving this competitive award. Auburn University has only 2 PGR fellows.

So I am a PhD fellow now :)
