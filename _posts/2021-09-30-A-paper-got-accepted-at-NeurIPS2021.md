Our paper: The effectiveness of feature attribution methods and its correlation with automatic evaluation scores got accepted at NeurIPS 2021.

I started this project at the final semester of Master at KAIST (in 2020) and submitted in around May 2021 -- working with Anh Nguyen (Auburn univ) and Daeyoung Kim (KAIST). We had 4/4 reviewers suggesting this paper for acceptance :)

For those who are not familiar with NeurIPS, this is the most prestigious venue for Machine Learning research or AI in general.
