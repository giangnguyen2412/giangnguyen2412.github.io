Our work [**PCNN: Probable-Class Nearest-Neighbor Explanations Improve Fine-Grained Image Classification Accuracy for AIs and Humans**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OcFjqiJ98b) got accepted at [Transactions on Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/).

We present a new class of nearest-neighbor explanations (called PCNN) and show a novel utility of the XAI method: To improve predictions of a frozen,
pretrained classifier **C**.
Our method consistently improves fine-grained image classification accuracy on CUB-200,
Cars-196, and Dogs-120.
Also, a human study finds that showing layusers our PCNN explanations
improves their decision accuracy over showing only the top-1 class examples (as in prior work).

This is a 2-year project and there is a very interesting story behind it.
